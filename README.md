# Mars-News
 This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

This information was obtained by identifying HTML elements using the URL, https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html.

We were able to extract information using automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing using Beatiful Soup.  We scraped information such as HTML tables and other recurrring elements on the web page.
